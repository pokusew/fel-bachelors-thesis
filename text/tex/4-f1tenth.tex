\chap[f1tenth] CTU's F1/10 Platform

The F1/10 platform is a scaled-down (1:10) model of an autonomous car that originates from F1/10 Autonomous Racing Competition (TODO: add ref or footnote). Thanks to its affordability and similarity to a real car, the platform can be easily used for the development, testing, and verification of autonomous driving systems and related algorithms.

At CTU, multiple F1/10 models have been created and used ~\cite[vajnar_f1tenth_2017, dusil_detection_2019, klapalek_avoidance_2019]. In this thesis, we focus on the latest iteration of the design represented by the models codenamed "tx2-auto-3"~\ref[img_tx2_auto_3] and "tx2-auto-usa"\footnote{This was designed by a fellow student, Tomáš Nagy. The main difference compared to the tx2-auto-3 is its chassis design (components' placement and mounting). The usa suffix in the model name refers to the fact that this model was assembled in the USA during our (my and Tomas Nagy's) internship at the University of Pennsylvania.}. This chapter aims to provide an up-to-date functional description of their hardware and software components. Such a description is a prerequisite for a successful migration to ROS 2 ~\ref[migration].

\sec Hardware Stack

The platform is based on an off-the-shelf RC car model from Traxxas (i.e., Traxxas Slash, but different ones can be used as well) with added components that enable autonomous operation (sensors, computers). The following table/list provides a quick overview of those components, which are then described in detail in the next sections. The diagram (ref diagram) shows the functional relationships among them.

\begitems
* NVIDIA Jetson TX2  – The main computing unit that runs the autonomous driving stack.
* VESC (Enertion FOCBOX VESC-X)– Electric Speed Controller (ESC) that controls the BLDC motor.
* Teensy 3.2 – A microcontroller (MCU) for controlling the steering and handling the communication with an RC Transmitter (Manual Control). It also implements an independent emergency stop (eStop).
* Hokuyo UST-10LX – LiDAR
* SparkFun 9DoF Razor IMU M0 – IMU
