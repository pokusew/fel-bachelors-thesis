\chap[intro] Introduction

Since the Robot Operating System was started in 2007~\cite[ros_history], it has gained great popularity and has become the standard in robotics community.
However, it has turned out that the original architecture (ROS~1) has some limitations concerning {\em performance, efficiency and real-time safety}.
Thus, a~new version of ROS -- {\em ROS~2} -- has been designed from ground up to allow more use-cases and solve pain points of ROS~1 ~\cite[ros2_design_why].
Missing features and incompatible packages have been slowing down the adoption of ROS~2 since its first public release in 2017.
But in recent years, the situation has improved a~lot, and the adoption of ROS~2 has accelerated~\cite[ros_metrics].
Thus, now it might be the right time start migrating applications from ROS~1 to ROS~2 and benefit from the new possibilities.

{\sbf The goal} of this project is to migrate a~selected part of the CTU's F1/10 project from ROS~1 Kinetic Kame to ROS~2 Foxy Fitzroy.
The result should be a~working port running on ROS~2 in a~simulator and on a~physical model car with NVIDIA Jetson computing module.

In the Chapter~\ref[ros], both versions of ROS are briefly described while highlighting main differences of ROS~2 when compared to ROS~1.

In the Chapter~\ref[f1tenth], the software and hardware stack of CTU's F1/10 project is introduced.
Then the Follow the Gap application is selected for migration to ROS~2.
The migration is described in Chapter~\ref[follow_the_gap].
The working of the migrated application is demonstrated in the Stage simulator on Ubuntu and macOS.
Test.

The Chapter~\ref[jetson] focuses on setting up an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module so that it can run ROS~2 applications.
The emphasis is given on providing a~good developer experience in environments where the Jetson module is shared among many students and researchers.
Thus, boot options of the Jetson modules are explored.
Then a~solution with a~bootable SD card is presented.

Finally, {\sbf the achieved results} are summarized in the last Chapter~\ref[conclusion].
