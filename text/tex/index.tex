\abstractEN {

	The new version of the Robot Operating System – ROS~2 – brings significant improvements
	over its predecessor ROS~1. We briefly describe both versions and compare their differences.
	Then we cover the process of migrating a ROS 1 application to ROS~2 on the example of the Follow the Gap app
	that is part of CTU's F1/10 project.

	In the next part, we focus on setting up an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module so that it can run ROS 2 applications and
	provide good developer experience in environments where Jetson module is shared among many students and
	researchers.

	The first result of this project is a~ROS~2 port of the Follow the Gap application. Its working is
	demonstrated in the Stage simulator on Ubuntu and macOS. The second result is a setup guide for NVIDIA Jetson
	TX2 that covers creating a fully-setup OS image with ROS 2 on a bootable SD card. The last result is a
	collection of setup guides and documentation that cover various aspects of working with ROS.
