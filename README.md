# Using ROS 2 for High-Speed Maneuvering in Autonomous Driving

My Bachelor's Thesis at [CTU FEE](https://fel.cvut.cz/en/) ([ČVUT FEL](https://fel.cvut.cz/cz/))

_This thesis is a continuation of the work from [my semestral project][fel-project]._


## Abstract

Performing high-speed maneuvers in autonomous driving is problematic without proper **real-time support.**
At CTU, there is a team that competes in the 🏎 [F1/10 Autonomous Driving Competition][f1tenth] with
autonomous model cars. Their autonomous driving stack is based on **ROS 1**, which is not suitable for
real-time applications.

**The goal is to migrate this stack to ROS 2** 🔝, which has been designed from the ground up to address many
issues in this area. We propose **tracing** as an efficient way to analyze a running ROS 2 system and measure
⏱️ important properties.

**Results:** We demonstrate the working of [the migrated stack][pokusew/f1tenth-rewrite] **on the F1/10
model car and in the Stage simulator**. 🚀
We [evaluate the communication latencies][pokusew/ros2-tracing-experiments] in the new stack using an extended
version of ROS 2 tracing tools 📊. Another result of our work is
a [publicly-available collection][pokusew/ros-setup] of setup guides, scripts, and documentation that covers
various aspects of working with ROS. These guides have already helped several people.

We hope that the results of this thesis build a foundation that opens the way for the adoption of ROS 2 in the
CTU's F1/10 stack, further improving its real-time properties, while making it more approachable by new
students.
